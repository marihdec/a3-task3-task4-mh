#### This data measures red and purple urchin populations and diameter (to nearest 0.5 cm) at 5 sites between 2008 and 2020. The data collection related to urchin populations where giant kelp is left intact vs where it is removed once annually.

## Read in the data using here() to create a system agnostic file path

```{r}
urchins <- read_csv(here("data", "urchins.csv"))
```

- First, I want to make the data more coder friendly.

```{r}
clean_urchins <- clean_names(urchins)
```

## Create a subset of clean_urchins containing:

- Change class of date column to "date" using lubridate::mdy
- Only for collections from the year 2010
- Only purple urchins
- Only urchin data collected at Naples Reef

```{r}
napl_urchins <- clean_urchins %>%
  mutate(date = mdy(date)) %>% # change class of column
  mutate(year = year(date)) %>% # create column for year only
  filter(year == 2010) %>%
  filter(common_name == "Purple Urchin") %>% # only purple urchins
  filter(site == "NAPL") # only at Naples Reef
```

## Create a faceted histogram and q-q plot for the size distribution of urchins depending on treatment

```{r}
ggplot(data = napl_urchins, aes(x = size)) +
  geom_histogram(bin = 10) +
  facet_wrap(~ treatment) +
  labs(x = "diameter (cm)")

ggplot(data = napl_urchins, aes(sample = size)) +
  geom_qq() +
  facet_wrap(~ treatment)
```

Main takeaways: The samples from populations undergoing both treatments have relatively normally distributed urchin diameter/size. Smaller urchins seem to have more success in areas where kelp was cleared annually, whereas areas where kelp was not removed had a more even distribution of sizes.
